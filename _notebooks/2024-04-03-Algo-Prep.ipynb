    "Today (April 3), my group along with four other groups got to perform each of our sorting algorithms in front of the judges as well as people who happened to be interested in watching us perform. I enjoyed watching every single performance, as I was amazed at all of the groups were able to get creative with showing off their sorting algorithms in their own unique way. For example, the insertion sort algorithm performance was pretty cool in that it used rap lyrics as well as a beach theme in order to convey the mechanisms of insertion sort. Also, the bubble sort performance was funny to me and many others who attended the event since the theme was centered around a dating show and a person wanting to figure out who their best match is. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of our own performance, I thought that everyone (including me) did an amazing job. I feel like all of us were punctual whenever we were practicing, whether it was at lunch, during class, or outside of school. Ultimately, all of those practice sessions played of in the end, as we were able to perform on the stage without any issues and earned two 10/10s and 3 9/10s from the judges, which is quite amazing. We ended up in 3rd place for total scores, which we all agreed was a pretty solid ranking. \n",
